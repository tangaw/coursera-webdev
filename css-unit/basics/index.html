      <h3>Subheading for Section 1</h3>
      <p>
        A CSS rule consists of selector, in this case it's a p, the paragraph tag, which is basically saying that whatever rules I'm about to give should apply to the content of every single paragraph tag in the entire HTML page. The selector is followed by open and close curly braces. Inside of those braces, we have CSS declaration.
